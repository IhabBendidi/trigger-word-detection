# Trigger word detection model 

## Context 
This is an implementation of a deep learning model for trigger word detection. The model enables, after training, to detect a trigger word mention in a speech. The model is currently trained using a digits dataset, and is being improved upon using precision and F1 scores criterias. Any improvements are very welcomed.

## Advancement
The model's precision is still being improved.

## How to Run
Require [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe) and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installed

### Install required libraries
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


### Real-time demo

In the project directory start a command line, then run command
```
jupyter notebook
